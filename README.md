===============
StringSearchAlgorithms (formerly StringAndChars) is a library for exact string matching algorithms (maybe later also approximate or complex string matching algorithms).

This Readme contains technical infos to the project (e.g. Problems, Roadmap or the State of Work)

Information on Usage and Download can be found on [StringSearchAlgorithms](http://stringsearchalgorithms.amygdalum.net/). 

Roadmap
-----
- Optimizations
- Regex Matching
- Tolerant Matching
