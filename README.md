===============
StringSearchAlgorithms (formerly StringAndChars) is a library for exact string matching algorithms (or string search algorithms).

It is planned that also complex string matching (with wildcards, regular expressions, string metrics) is supported.

This Readme contains technical infos to the project (e.g. Problems, Roadmap or the State of Work)

Information on Usage and Download can be found on [StringSearchAlgorithms](http://stringsearchalgorithms.amygdalum.net/). 

Roadmap
-----
- Optimizations
- Regex Matching
- Tolerant Matching
